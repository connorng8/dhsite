I noticed that there are around 5 names of places among the list (such as Rome, Coliseum, Vatican, Italy). It is interesting how there was not that many names of places that come up, as I would expect for there to at least be a little more since the romans did conquer a lot of land. There is also a small number of ethnic groups within the list such as: Romans, Egyptians, Christians, Jewish. I expected this more as the books are mainly about the Romans and their history. A majority of the list is composed of names of individuals (such as Titus, Eugenius, Pompey, Caesars, Augustus and many more). This makes a good amount of sense as a lot of the history of the Roman empire was either about or written by important individuals and their names would become a part of the history itself (especially when there records from that time period is scarce). There was a lot of ambiguous names as well (like “Whatever, Capitol, Whole, Fifth and more), which is likely because of the program not being completely optimized to only find names. 

What points is this paper trying to explain? 
The paper is trying to explain how Gibbon was impacted by geography and how it played a role in his work. It talks about the fact that he studied a lot of geography (especially historical geography) and wrote many papers on the accuracy of locations/maps. It tells that he did not abandon his interesting in geography when creating “Decline and Fall”, but rather used geography as a component in telling the history of the Roman empire. 

Who are the people that this article mentions? Can you get background information about them online, whether from Wikipedia or elsewhere? Can you figure out what is going on? 
There are a lot of geographers that are mentioned within this paper (such as Strabo, Ptolemy, Thomas Shaw, Carsten Niebuhr and Abulfeda) because Gibbon very much praised these geographers for having accurate representations of geography and used their works to create descriptions of land. Gibbon also owned many books about geography by authors such as Anton Büsching, Peter Heylyn, William Temple and many more, showing that he had an interest in geography before even thinking of writing about the fall of the Roman Empire. All the authors of the books that Gibbon studied varied from different times and locations as they seemed to all specialize in certain parts of the world, giving Gibbon a quite diverse view of the geography of this part of the world. 

What might WE do to accomplish this goal better? 
If the goal is to get a better understanding of the geography within Gibbon’s “Decline and Fall”, we can definitely create programs that help identify certain names of locations (both from the past and present) and actually map them out. Since we now can essentially confirm whether certain claimed distances are true or false (thanks to the internet), we can create programs that show the claims in which Gibbon may not have been totally correct about. We can also figure out what locations are mentioned more often in which parts of the text (and during what time period is being mentioned within the text) to show how the Roman Empire evolved over time. Since we are so much more advanced now, we have the ability to confirm and visualize these locations without ever actually needing to travel there.

How might we more generally convey the way Gibbon talks about space? Do we care? If so, what would be helpful? 
We can more generally convey the way Gibbon talks about space by figuring out what historical locations that he may mention in his text that do not exist today and help show where exactly these locations are now. This would be helpful as doing so may help the reader get an understanding of what the distances from certain locations to another were like during that time period, even if you cannot travel there today.
